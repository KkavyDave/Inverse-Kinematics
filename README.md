Use a USB cable to connect the Arduino UNO to the PC and upload the provided code by selecting 'Tools -> Board -> Arduino UNO' and choosing the correct serial port in 'Tools -> Port'.
In this assignment we were supposed to perform and analysis robotic movements accordingly after passing on the values for x, y and angle for which we will be using the variable gamma in the Arduino code for 3 DOF.
As we can see in the above given diagram we used for calculation we frame a condition for reachable length and calculate the values of alpha, beta and gamma. Gamma here is the summation of all the angles theta1, theta2, theta 3 for the 3 DOFâ€™s represented in the picture.
We have derived the values of theta1, theta2 and theta3 accordingly and implemented them in Arduino IDE respectively.
